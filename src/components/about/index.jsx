                    <h5>When you sign up for THRIVE, you are acknowledging that you matter and you are ready to commit to taking care of yourself so that you can take care of everything else in your life. Thrive starts with a masterclass that covers a lot of the tools and knowledge for how to truly thrive. You will receive a planner that we will use over the next 8 weeks as we do check ins and continue to learn and grow together. Each week you will receive more education and you will have a community of women to support you as you implement new tools and create new habits. At the end of the 8 weeks we will evaluate how much you have grown and how much more confident you are in your ability to grow your career while still being there for everything that your family needs. </h5>
